Project Report.
1)
This project implements a simple random password generator in Java.
The program takes user input to determine the desired length of the password
and which character types to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols).
2)
It then generates a password that meets these criteria.
User Input: The program uses the Scanner class to get input from the user regarding password length and desired character types.
The char data type is used to store the user's 'yes' or 'no' responses for including different character sets.
3)
Character Distribution: The random character selection might not result
in a perfectly even distribution of character types in the generated password,
especially for shorter passwords.
